Bug reporting
=============

If you run into a problem with Anbox creating a bug report is the right way to
get in touch with the developer community. The following will describe the steps
you should follow when reporting a bug.

Check if the bug is already reported
------------------------------------

The very first thing you should always do is to check the `Anbox bug tracker <https://github.com/anbox/anbox/issues>`_
for an existing bug report which matches the problem you're experiencing. If one
already exist please don't file a new one but ammend to the existing one.

Update to the latest version of Anbox
-------------------------------------

Before you report a bug you should make sure you can reproduce it with the latest
version of Anbox. To refresh the snap package simply run the following command:

.. code-block:: text

     $ snap refresh --edge --devmode Anbox


Once the refresh is done try to reproduce the bug you've found. If it is still
present continue with the next steps.


Collect all necessary information for the bug report
----------------------------------------------------

When you attempt to create a bug report on our github project you will be asked
to provide various information so developers have an easier job to find a solution
for your problem. Please make sure you follow these steps!

Create the bug report
---------------------

Once you have all information together go to the `bug tracker <https://github.com/anbox/anbox/issues/new>`_
and create the bug report. 

A developer will confirm and triage your bug, then work can begin on it. If you are
missing any information, you will be asked for it, so make sure to check in often!
